Peer Assessment 1 for Reproducible Research

This repository contains my submission for Peer Assessment 1 for Reproducible Research in the Coursera/Johns Hopkins Data Science
specialization program.  The repo contains the data used, the Rmd, .html and .md files PA1_template, the data used in the analysis
and a folder containing the figures.

The original dataset was downloaded December 4th from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip
